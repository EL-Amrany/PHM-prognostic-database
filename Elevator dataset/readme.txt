This dataset is from Huawei German Research Center and was provided by a Kaggle user in the Kaggle Platform.

The dataset was collected from IoT sensors in the elevator industry for predictive maintenance of elevator doors. 

The dataset includes time-series data sampled at 4Hz during high-peak and evening elevator usage in a building, featuring data from various sensors such as electromechanical, ambiance, and physics sensors. The target of the dataset is to predict the absolute value of vibration.
