This dataset was provided by a member of Essilingen University in the Kaggle platform.

The degradation process that was observed in this dataset is related to the clogging of filters during the separation of solid particles from gas.

the dataset contains training and test data, consisting both of 50 life tests respectively.

We can use the test data in order to estimate the remaining useful life because this data contains randomly right-censored run-to-failure measurements and the respective RUL as ground truth to the prediction task.
